# Hotel By Location
Ever did research for your hotel or hostel and found the perfect one and booked it...but when you get there you realize that it's location is far away from the places you want to visit? I, personally, have and that is why I am building this so that I can find a great hotel or hostel and be in better vicinity to the places I want to visit.

- Visualize locations you want to visit and potential hotels or hostels on the same map
- Hide hotels or hostels on the map that you do not want to stay at
- See travel times from the hotel or hostel to the different travel locations
- Confidentally find the right hotel or hostel for your next trip
